    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Since its inception in 2008, Airbnb has disrupted the hospitality industry by allowing almost anyone to rent out a spare room and host travelers looking for an overnight stay. \n",
    "\n",
    "While Airbnb has publicly available data from many locations, **Santa Clara County is of particular interest as it is one of the major counties in the Bay Area and home to many prominent tech companies and startups in the Silicon Valley.**\n",
    "As such, home prices and cost of living are exceptionally high in this area, as one will see in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content\n",
    "\n",
    "All data is publicly available under the Creative Commons \"Public Domain Dedication\" license and has been updated as of June 12th, 2020.Provided are metrics that are publicly visible for each listing (e.g. name, description, price, reviews, etc.), but the dataset contains some Airbnb's internal metrics as well (review score accuracy, host acceptance rate, etc.).\n",

    "1. Create a price-suggestion model for new Airbnb hosts who might not know the value of their listing.\n",
    "    - Text mining with statified house price data\n",
    "2. Can we predict the rating of an Airbnb listing utilizing **NLP** of the description columns?How have Airbnb\n",
    "3. prices changed over time? Are prices seasonal?\n",
    "   - Time series analysis?\n",
    "4. Which areas in the Santa Clara County are most \"popular\"?\n",
    "   - Region analysis\n",
    "5. Which features of an Airbnb listing are important to add to its perceived value?\n",
